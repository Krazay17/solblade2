3. Overwrite main completely with your branch

If your goal is for main to exactly match redo_actors, the safest way is to replace main:

Option A: Merge with “ours” strategy
git checkout main
git merge -s ours redo_actors
git checkout redo_actors -- .
git commit -m "Replace main with redo_actors"


This tells Git: “Treat the merge as resolved in favor of our branch,” then copies the files from redo_actors.

History stays, but files are replaced exactly.

Option B: Force push (simplest if main’s history doesn’t matter)
git checkout redo_actors
git push origin redo_actors:main --force


This makes main exactly match your branch.

Warning: This rewrites main history. Anyone else working on main will have problems unless they reset to your new history.
